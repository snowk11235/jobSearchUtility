# jobSearchUtility
This is a work-in-progress re-vamp of a job search utility I wrote in one of my CS courses.

At a high level, it:
  > pulls JSON and XML data from various job search APIS.
  > "massages" the incoming data and inserts it into an SQLITE database.
  > Presents the data graphically, including searching and filtering functionality.
